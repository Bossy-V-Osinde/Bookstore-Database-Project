# Bookstore Database Project

## Overview

This project is focused on building a **relational database** using **MySQL** to store and manage data for a **Bookstore**. The system will efficiently handle information such as books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, and related data. This project provides hands-on experience in database design, table creation, and querying, which are essential skills for managing large-scale data systems.

## Tools and Technologies

- **MySQL**: For building and managing the relational database.
- **Draw.io**: For visualizing the database schema and relationships.

1. Design and implement a relational database for a bookstore.
2. Create tables to store and manage data related to books, authors, customers, and orders.
3. Use SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data.
4. Set up user roles and permissions to control access to the database.
